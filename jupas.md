Interest: Coding

Coding is my favourite thing to do in my spare time. It's relaxing and I really enjoy coding while having a voice call with my friends.
We used to talk about difficultes when developing new features for our Youtube Downloader project

I want to work in web-related jobs, such as front-end developer or cyber security specialist in the future, So I hope I can learn some related skills

Teamwork is essential in coding, as it combines diverse skills and perspectives to tackle complex problems more effectively. When developers collaborate, they share knowledge, which leads to innovative solutions and enhanced creativity. Each team member brings unique strengths—be it in front-end design, back-end architecture, or debugging—allowing for a more comprehensive approach to software development. Moreover, effective communication within a team fosters a supportive environment, where ideas can be freely exchanged, and feedback is constructive. Ultimately, teamwork not only accelerates project completion but also results in higher quality code, as multiple sets of eyes contribute to thorough testing and refinement.

I want to dicover the secret behind it, So later decided to build a static website as my starting point of programming... well not really as html is only a markup language.Anyways, after countless hours of searching reasons I have a unwanted output in Stack Overflow and Github which usually turn out to be a typing mistake,I made one about myself. From awards I have got, to video games I love. I am satifised by just looking it. Looking at the awesome work I had ever done.

Programmers always have stereotypes of being introverted and night owls. However, coding actully remind me the importance of teamwork and time management.
You might be surprised by how people work with others with coding, but in large project, different indeviduals or team will incharge of different feature of the same applications. For example, the youtube downloader project that I am working on consists UI and backend
