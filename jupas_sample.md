From the moment I received my first computer at the age of eight, I was captivated by the endless possibilities it offered.
I spent countless hours exploring its features, fascinated by how a series of commands or running scripts that could create vibrant graphics and interactive experiences.
My early curiosity led me to dismantle old gadgets, eager to understand their inner workings,
and I quickly realized that computers were more than just machines â€” they were gateways to creativity and innovation.

In primary school, I discovered a passion for coding through an online game that allowed players to create their own levels.
I was hooked. I began teaching myself HTML and CSS, excited to build my first website dedicated to my favorite video games. Each successful project fueled my desire to learn more, and I found joy in troubleshooting errors and refining my designs.

As I progressed through secondary school, I joined the Tech and Creative Club, where I collaborated with like-minded peers on various projects. I particularly enjoyed developing a program that helped students track their homework assignments, combining my love for technology with a desire to assist others.

Outside of school, I volunteered at a local community center, teaching younger students the basics of programming. Watching their excitement as they created their first lines of code reminded me of my own early experiences and reinforced my belief in the power of technology to inspire.

My childhood fascination with computers has evolved into a clear aspiration to study computer science at university. I am eager to explore areas such as software development and artificial intelligence, where I can continue to blend creativity with technical skills. I look forward to the opportunity to innovate and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
